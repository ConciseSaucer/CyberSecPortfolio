# Education

**Cyber Academy Accelerated Associate of Applied Science (AAS)**
>
> The Associate of Applied Science in Cybersecurity is offered at locations across the state of Indiana, but Ivy Tech Columbus also offers an accelerated way to earn your degree in partnership with Muscatatuck
> Urban Training Center, a national Department of Defense military base.
>
> Students in this nationally-recognized program live on the base during their training and take advantage of over 300 real-life training structures including the Cybertropolis simulation city.

### What is the Cyber Academy?
> The Cyber Academy is based at Muscatatuck Urban Training Center (MUTC), located between Cincinnati, Louisville and Indianapolis. MUTC serves as a U.S. Department of Defense training facility and is home to the Cybertropolis, a Department of Defense urban cyber testing and training environment.
>
> Cyber Academy students are immersed in this training environment, experiencing the most advanced, state-of-the-art cybersecurity training available.

## Code
### IP sweeper
Requires rofi, nmap, and xsltproc
```bash
#!/bin/bash

interface=$(ip -c=never -br -4 addr | rofi -dmenu - p "which interface do you want to use?" | cut -d " " -f 1)
myip=$(ip -c=never -br -4 addr show $interface | awk '{print $3}' | cut -d "/" -f 1)
netid=$(ip -c=never -br 4 addr show $interface | awk '{print $3}' | cut -d "." -f 1-3)
file1=$(mktemp)
echo "Starting scan....."

for ip in $(seq 1 254); do
ping -c 1 -W 2 $netid.$ip | grep "bytes from" | cut -d " " -f 4 | cut -d ":" -f 1 >> $file1 &
done

sleep 3
file2=$(mktemp)
grep -v $myip $file1 | sort -V >> $file2

scan=$(cat $file2 | rofi -dmenu -p "What IP do you want to scan?")
scan_type=$(echo -e "1. Quick Scan\n2. Stealth Scan\n3. Full Scan" | rofi -dmenu -p "What type of scan do you want to use?" | cut -d '.' -f 1)
echo "Starting the scan of $scan"

if [[ $scan_type == "1" ]]; then
  nmap $scan -oX $scan.xml
elif [[ $scan_type == "2" ]]; then
  nmap -Pn -sS $scan -oX $scan.xml
elif [[ $scan_type == "3" ]]; then
  nmap -T4 -A -O -sC $scan -oX $scan.xml
fi

xsltproc $scan.xml -o $scan.html

rm $file1 $file2 $scan.xml
setsid firefox $scan.html &
```
### Port Scanner
```py

    target = socket.gethostbyname(sys.argv[1])
else:
    print("Invalid amount of arguments.")
    print("Syntax: python3 scanner.py <ip>")
if not target:
    target = input("Enter the ip address")
#Prints Header
print("-"*50)
print(f"Scanning target:{target}")
print(f"Time started:{datetime.now()}")
print("-"*50)
try:
    for port in range(1,150):
        s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        socket.setdefaulttimeout(1)
        result = s.connect_ex((target,port))
        if result == 0:
            print(f"Port {port} is open")
        s.close()
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("\nExiting program")
    sys.exit()
except socket.gaierror:
    print("Hostname could not be resolved")
    sys.exit()

    print("Could not connect to server.")
    sys.exit()
